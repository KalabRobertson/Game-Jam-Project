# Game Jam
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme
We interpreted the theme as a timewarp or crunch. This sends our main character back in time to another world. He's only got one shot to make it back to his home timeline.

## Game Play
Make it to the portal while evading the enemies that surround you.
2D Sidescroller keybinds. A to move left. D to move right. W to jump. Escape to pause/quit.

## Impediments
Finding the right assets was a major struggle in the beginning and really slowed our progress. Our original repository corrupted, so luckily I made a back up of all of the game files.

## Implementation
Animated Assets, Music, Parallax, Interesting Level Design, Hazards, Attention to start and end game screens.  
Assets, or resources used
